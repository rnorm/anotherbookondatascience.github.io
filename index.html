          <h2>Why am I writing this book?</h2>
          <p>
              Maybe a major reason is an existential crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
              The feedback from readers is another important reason. A few months ago I submitted a git repo with three Chapters of this book in PDF format to Hacker News, and surprisingly the repo got 500 stars in a week. I received a few emails expressing thanks and interests in more Chapters. Since then, I have been working on this project constantly.
          </p>

          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>There has been considerable debate over choosing R vs. Python for Data Science. I started to learn Python when I was an undergraduate. At that time I never heard of Data Science. A few years later I read an R script for the first time. Since then R had been my primary programming language for quite a while during my Ph.D. study. I also used to learn new programming languages as a hobby. Based on my limited knowledge/experience, both R and Python are great languages and are worth learning; so why not learn them together? 
          </p>



          <p>
            The book is still under development. And the code can be found at this git <a href="https://github.com/rnorm/book_sample">repo</a>. If you have any idea to share or find any errors of the book, please contact me directly via email setseed2016@gmail.com.
          </p>
          <p> You may find the structure of this book loose, deliberately. Because the definition of Data Science is vague.
          </p>


          <p>
          A PDF version of this book would be available soon!
          </p>

          <h2>Target audience</h2>

          <p>
              <ul>
                  <li>If you have little programming experience, and want to learn it</li>
                  <li>If you know either R or Python, and want to learn the other</li>
                  <li>If you are interested in Data Science or Quantitative Analytics</li>
                  <li>If you want to see how to implement some basic machine learning models from scratch, such as linear regression (ridge, Lasso), gradient boosting regression, etc.</li>
                  <li>Or if you just want to read it</li>
