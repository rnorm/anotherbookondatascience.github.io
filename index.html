          <h2>Why am I writing this book?</h2>
          <p>
              Maybe a major reason is an existential crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
              The feedback from readers is another important reason. A few months ago I submitted a git repo with three Chapters of this book in PDF format to Hacker News, and surprisingly the repo got 500 stars in a week. I received a few emails expressing thanks and interests in more Chapters. Since then, I have been working on this project constantly.
          </p>

          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>There has been considerable debate over choosing R vs. Python for Data Science. I started to learn Python when I was an undergraduate. At that time I never heard of Data Science. A few years later I read an R script for the first time. Since then R had been my primary programming language for quite a while during my Ph.D. study. I also used to learn new programming languages as a hobby. Based on my limited knowledge/experience, both R and Python are great languages and are worth learning; so why not learn them together? 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Besides the side-by-side comparison of the two popular languages used in Data Science, this book also focuses on the translation from mathematical models to codes. In the book, the audience could find the applications/implementations of some important algorithms from scratch, such as maximum likelihood estimation, inversion sampling, copula simulation, simulated annealing, bootstrapping, linear regression (lasso/ridge regression), logistic regression, gradient boosting trees, etc.
          </p>
